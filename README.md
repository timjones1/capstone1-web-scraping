### Scraping legal case information from bailii.org

This is part one of a capstone project I completed during the Cambridge Spark bootcamp. The project was proposed by wavelength.law. I made use of Beautiful Soup to extract legal case information from the Bailii.org website. I also used a pretrained Spacy Named Entity Recognition Model called Blackstone, trained on English legal texts, to extract relevant sections and Acts from the legal cases.

My Project report is available [here]()
